## Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
- **Purpose**: Adapt the YOLOv8x model to the effects of quantization to mitigate accuracy loss when model parameters are converted to lower-precision formats.

## Model Conversion
- **Conversion Targets**: Convert the quantized model to formats suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices, specifically ONNX and TensorFlow Lite.
- **Key Considerations**: Ensure the conversion process preserves quantization parameters and optimizes the models for low-power devices like Raspberry Pi.

## Optimization Techniques
### Hardware Acceleration
- **Devices to Consider**: Google Coral or Intel Neural Compute Stick, which can significantly enhance processing speed.

### Optimized Libraries
- **Usage**: Employ libraries such as TensorFlow Lite Runtime, optimized for ARM processors prevalent in Raspberry Pis.

### Environment Tuning
- **Strategy**: Adjust the deployment environment by fine-tuning parameters and using profiling tools to strike a balance between performance and accuracy.

## Performance Adjustments
### Reduce Input Resolution
- **Impact**: Lowering video resolution reduces the computational load, facilitating faster processing.

### Frame Skipping
- **Approach**: Process fewer frames per second to maintain a balance between detection quality and processing speed.

## Testing and Continuous Adjustment
- **Ongoing Process**: Extensively test the model in the actual deployment environment and continuously refine settings based on performance and accuracy feedback.
