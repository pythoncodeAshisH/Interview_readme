# Annotation Types and Suitable Models for Training

## 1. Bounding Boxes
- **Description**: Rectangles that fully encompass an object within an image. Used for object detection tasks.
- **Models**:
  - **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Fast, efficient, suitable for real-time processing.
  - **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)**: Balances between speed and accuracy, works well in various conditions.
  - **Faster R-CNN**: Offers high accuracy, uses a region proposal network for detecting objects.

## 2. Semantic Segmentation
- **Description**: Pixel-level annotations where each pixel is classified into a category. Useful for understanding the scene at a more granular level.
- **Models**:
  - **FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)**: Adapts classical networks like AlexNet for pixel-wise prediction.
  - **DeepLab**: Uses atrous convolutions to effectively capture multi-scale context.
  - **U-Net**: Popular in medical image segmentation due to its efficient use of data and powerful architecture for detailed segmentation.

## 3. Instance Segmentation
- **Description**: Combines object detection and semantic segmentation, distinguishing individual objects of the same class.
- **Models**:
  - **Mask R-CNN**: Extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting segmentation masks on each Region of Interest (RoI), effectively separating different objects.
  - **YOLACT (You Only Look At CoefficienTs)**: Real-time instance segmentation model that separates the detection of bounding boxes and the prediction of segmentation masks.

## 4. Keypoint Detection
- **Description**: Identifies specific points of interest within an object, commonly used in human pose estimation.
- **Models**:
  - **OpenPose**: Real-time system to jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints.
  - **PoseNet**: A lightweight model that can detect human figures in images and videos so quickly that it can run on mobile devices.

## 5. Lines and Curves
- **Description**: Annotations for lines and curves are essential for tasks like lane detection in autonomous driving.
- **Models**:
  - **SCNN (Spatial CNN)**: Enhances traditional CNNs to better model the spatial relationships, ideal for tasks requiring understanding of lines and geometries in the context, such as roads.
  - **LaneNet**: Specifically designed to detect lanes by modeling them as lines which might be beneficial in simpler setups or dedicated lane detection tasks.
